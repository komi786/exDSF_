If liquid, quantity stands for the total amount dispensed or ordered of ingredient in the units given by the drug_strength table. If the unit from the source data does not align with the unit in the DRUG_STRENGTH table the quantity should be converted to the correct unit given in DRUG_STRENGTH. For clinical drugs with fixed dose forms (tablets etc.) the quantity is the number of units/tablets/capsules prescribed or dispensed (can be partial, but then only 1/2 or 1/3, not 0.01). Clinical drugs with divisible dose forms (injections) the quantity is the amount of ingredient the patient got. For example, if the injection is 2mg/mL but the patient got 80mL then quantity is reported as 160.
Quantified clinical drugs with divisible dose forms (prefilled syringes), the quantity is the amount of ingredient similar to clinical drugs. Please see [how to calculate drug dose](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/drug_dose.html) for more information.
